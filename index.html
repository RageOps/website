      <p>My name is Devan Schneider. I am in the class of 2025 at NC State, with an intended major 
        in <ins>Computer Science</ins>. I chose this major because technology has always
        been something that interested me. I love the logic behind it and think that solving problems
        with code is fascinating. Right now I am learning lua, python and javascript, to give myself some
        foundations.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; color:#1fe6d5; text-align: center;">
        My dream job would be to work at a major company that has a software development team that
        is focused on human-input bionics. I want it to be a team environment because as much as I
        appreciate working on code by myself, I think that would get lonely way too quickly. I need
        a team to work and collaborate with to keep myself thinking, bounce ideas off of others, and
        to work my way into a leadership position. 
      </p>
